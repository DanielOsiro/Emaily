# Emaily

Application to send survey based emails which can track users responses. Built following Stephen Grider's "Node with React: Fullstack Web Development" course with a few custom enhancements.

## How to run this app locally

Start local node and react server

```
npm run dev
```

Open tunnel to localhost (optional webhook testing)

```
npm run tunnel
```

After starting the development environment, the browser will automatically open with the react application. In case this doesn't happen, you can access localhost:3000.
